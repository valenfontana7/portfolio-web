// ARCHIVE: original legacy renderer moved during React migration
// Path original: js/modules/renderProjects.js
// Content preserved for historical/reference purposes.
// DEPRECATED: moved to React island at src/react/components/Projects.jsx
// This file kept as a harmless stub to avoid runtime import errors in older environments.
export function renderProjects() {
  // No-op. Use the React Projects component instead.
  // If you see this log, some code is still importing the legacy renderer.
  console.warn('[renderProjects] NO-OP: use src/react/components/Projects.jsx');
